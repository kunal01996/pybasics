# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
# and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
# For practice, write this code inside a function.


def first_and_last(list):

    return [list[0], list[-1]]


print(first_and_last([5, 10, 15, 20, 25]))
